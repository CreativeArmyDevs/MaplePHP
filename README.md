# MaplePHP
**MaplePHP is a layered structure PHP framework** that has been meticulously crafted to provide developers with an intuitive, user-friendly experience that doesn't compromise on performance or scalability. By leveraging a modular architecture with **full PSR support**, the framework allows for easy customization and flexibility, enabling developers to pick and choose the specific components they need to build their applications. Overall, the PHP Fuse framework is an excellent choice for developers looking to build high-quality web applications quickly and efficiently.

MaplePHP's commitment to **agnosticism** ensures that it remains **free of dependencies**, allowing developers the flexibility to choose dependencies based on their specific project needs rather than being dictated by the framework. The framework's streamlined approach guarantees it avoids bloat by incorporating only essential libraries, each serving a distinct purpose without redundancy.

Moreover, MaplePHP sets itself apart through its seamless communication between the backend and the frontend, facilitated by Stratoxjsâ€”a purpose-built tool tailored specifically for Maple. This integration enhances the framework's unique capabilities, fostering efficient and effective development of high-quality web applications.

## Much more to be done
The MaplePHP framework is still a work in progress, with over 800 points on my checklist that need attentionâ€”no exaggeration. Despite its incompleteness, I'm enthusiastic about showcasing its notable features. However, I advise against utilizing the framework for actual projects at this time. It's best to wait until version 1.1.0, by which point I'll have addressed all the existing issues and provided comprehensive documentation for a more stable and reliable experience.

**With that said...** The libraries bellow is should all be stable.

## Installation
Right now installation will only be available through **git** because of I have made every library as an **submodule**. This might change soon.
```
composer create-project maplephp/maplephp myApp
```
